# pwnapi
pwnapi is a CTF framework inspired to [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools), powered by Python 3 and [radare2](https://github.com/radare/radare2).

It aims to be as simple and small as possible, accordingly to a KISS and minimalist philosophy.

## Installation
Python 3 with `pip` and `radare2` are needed.

If you don't have radare2, you can install it from git with:
```
git clone https://github.com/radare/radare2 && cd radare2 && sys/install.sh
```
You can now install pwnapi with:
```
git clone https://github.com/ndaprela/pwnapi && cd pwnapi && make install
```

## Update
You can update pwnapi with:
```
make update
```
